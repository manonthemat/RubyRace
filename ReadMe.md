#QuickStart

Write your solutions into race.rb, run

    rspec race_spec.rb

and make all the tests pass.

#Same thing with more blah blah
Hello WDI 7/8 (best eva),

in this repository you'll find 5 Ruby problems that we'd like you to solve.

Clone this repository

    git clone https://github.com/manonthemat/RubyRace.git
    
then run the tests via

    rspec race_spec.rb

in the root-directory of the cloned repository.

When you first run the tests, part of the output shall say: *8 examples, 8 failures*.

Your job is to make the tests pass. Read the description of the tests to understand what the functions should do.

Edit the race.rb

    vim race.rb

to make the tests pass one by one.

Only edit the function-body of the functions defined in race.rb. You may require modules from the standard-library on top of the race.rb.

**After solving a puzzle, pass the MacBook to another team member.**

Every student has to be on the keyboard at least once.

##Troubleshooting

Can't run the tests? Don't have rspec installed? (That'd be very weird...)

    gem install rspec
